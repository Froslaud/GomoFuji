Privacy Policy
Effective Date: July 30, 2024

1. Introduction

Welcome to Froslaud. At GomoFuji, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting our users' personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our app.

2. Information We Collect

At GomoFuji, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information about our users. Our app merely stores data locally on the user's device. This data relates to information about anime and manga you have viewed and is stored only on your device so that you can have a list accessible without an internet connection.

3. Use of Data

The data stored locally on your device is used only to offer you a more personalized experience and to maintain an up-to-date list of anime and manga on your device. This data is not sent to our servers or shared with third parties.

4. Data Security

We take security very seriously. Information stored locally on your device is protected by standard security measures provided by the device's operating system. However, we cannot guarantee absolute data security in all cases, as this also depends on the security of the device itself.

5. We Do Not Share Information

Since we do not collect personally identifiable information or send data to our servers, we do not share information with third parties.

6. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on the app. You are advised to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
